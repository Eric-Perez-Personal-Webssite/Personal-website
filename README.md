# Personal-website - This projected is intended to allow me to share my current work and knowledge about myself. This will show my progression 
# from the beggining of my fullstack program.
# First, each different hmtl will contain different components for the website, such as one would be for the main page, one will be an about section, and one will be a section dedicated for a showcase of my projects.
# Second, there is the javascript section that will manipulate the website to display the information in a certain way to seperate into compartments.
# Lastly, the css will allow for color and formating to occur, which will allow for the audience to be hooked to interact with my website
# Each different type of language is split into different branches, such as a specific branch for html, then there is a specific branch for css, and finally a branch for javascript.
